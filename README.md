## ArtSense

Identifying Painting styles as a non-artist and an individual who's unfamiliar with paintings is not an easy task to deal with. Simply analyzing may be challenging, as painting style varies in terms of shape, color, texture, and the message it wants to convey. Thereby, ArtSense, an application developed with Flutter and Dart, incorporates an 
integrated model using TensorFlow, utilizing Convolutional Neural Network as its intelligence with the aim to identify whether a certain image belongs to a specific painting artstyle, was developed. This application marks a significant step toward making art appreciation more accessible and inclusive for individuals regardless of their artistic background.

Figure 1.2. Paintings tab

The application allows users to either input and select images from their gallery or capture a painting using its camera. The selected image is then processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which analyzes the image's pattern to identify its art style. It also has Painting tab shown in the picture above where description and image sample of all classes were displayed. The application was developed using Dart and Flutter using Android studio as the IDE.
